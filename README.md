This repository focuses on my Machine Learning practice.

Following are the topics that are covered:
1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Regression
3. Gradient Descent
4. Saving the Model Using Joblib and Pickle
5. Dummy Variables & One Hot Encoding
6. Training & Testing Data
7. Logistic regression
8. Decision Tree
9. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
10. Random Forest
11. K Fold Cross Validation
12. K Means Clustering Algorithm
13. Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm
14. Hyper Parameter Tuning
15. L1 and L2 Regularization
16. K Nearest Neighbors classification
17. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
18. Bias vs Variable in ML
19. Ensemble Learning - Bagging

Each topic has one learning-based jupyter notebook and one exercise-based jupyter notebook.
